# FDA-Approved-Drugs
Dataset of FDA approved drugs along with approval date and some physicochemical properties

This dataset was compiled by hand as the Njardarson Dataset (see selected publications) and expanded using Drug Central entries. Physicochemical properties were generated using SwissADME.
